    A railway reservation system is software that handles distribution, 
    pricing, scheduling, and other railway operations. 
    Most providers have some of these functions digitized, 
    but as we mentioned, this is done sporadically. 
    We want to talk about four main modules of reservation systems and cover extra integrations 
    to be on the lookout for.</p>

            Somewhere in the middle of the process, the engine can also apply custom business 
            rules to prioritize how search results are displayed or package several services 
            into a single offer, which increases sales. 
            Booking engines are used on a railway operator’s website and an app 
            and can also surface in different types. For example, you can have a separate engine 
            for corporate clients and distributors. In this case, they are usually accessed via 
            an extranet.​​</span><br></p>
